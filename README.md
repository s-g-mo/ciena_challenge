# ciena_challenge

I participated in a programming challenge by Ciena.

The challenge was time-limited (2-hours), and I couldn't use 3rd party libraries.

There were 3 problems. I solved 2/3 of the problems and ran out of time while working
on the third.

Sometimes it's good to work under constraints. It forces you to get creative!
